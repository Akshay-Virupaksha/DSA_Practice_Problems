# Data Structures and Algorithms – A2Z Practice

This repository contains my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms** following  
**Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**, starting from the basics and progressing step by step.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Maintain consistent coding practice
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Keep a structured record of my DSA learning journey

---

## Reference Sheet

I am following **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet** as the primary roadmap for problem selection and topic order.

## Approach

For each problem, I try to include:
- Clear and readable code
- A brief explanation of the approach

Note: Problems are organized topic-wise to match the learning progression.

---

## Language Used
- Python

---

## Progress

This repository is updated **daily** as I solve new problems.

Consistency is the primary focus rather than rushing through difficulty levels.

---

## Note

This repository reflects my personal learning journey.  
Some solutions may be iterative or basic as I strengthen fundamentals over time.
